	 <p style="font-size:30px;font-family:cursive;color:gold"> My name is Marlen Solis and I am an 11th grade student at Sun Valley Magnet School. My birthday is in August. My favorite sport is basketball but I also enjoy playing and watching other sports as well. Things I like to do are play sports, go hiking, and go to the beach. Once I graduate from high school I would like to go to the University of San Diego, Berkeley, or Irvine. I want to major in mechanical engineer because it is something I have got intrest in since I have been in the last three years of engineering at my school. </p>
